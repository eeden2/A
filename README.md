# APK-Encrypted-Chat-Room
This is the same concept as the Java Encrypted Chat Room Repository that I developed, but an APK version for a client connection felt crucial to the practicality of the project.
RSA Encryption is still used here with a key exchange between the Server and Client to ensure a secure connection. All keys are randomized at the start to maintain anonymity for each and every use.
